# T3fx

Simple framework which is inspired by TYPO3 Flow but I won't rebuild or recreate the whole thing. At the moment
I want to build some tools but I don't want to use a big application framework like Flow for it. And I want to
build something without a goal. This framework is at the moment only a bunch of files so I can programm some nice code.
